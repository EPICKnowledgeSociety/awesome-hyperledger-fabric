## Important Insights

### Block Size and Performance
- It is found that the performance of Fabric increases with large Block size
- It is demonstrated that Raft is superior to Kafka

### Challenges for Scheduling Tasks
- Fabric consists of heterogeneous components performing different operations, 
- Hence it is difficult to apply the same scheduling policy to the Fabric components.
- Peers consume 2.3 times the time slice than the orderers 
- Fabric can experience performance degradation when components run with co-located tasks.

## Questions and Answers

### What are the conditions for generating blocks from transactions
### Answer: 
- the number of transactions in the block reaches the threshold
- the block size attains the maximum value in bytes
- certain time has passed since the first transaction of the new block was received. 

### Why does peers take more time slice than orderers and chaincodes ?
### Answer:
- It is because peers perform verification of the clientâ€™s transaction proposals and validate new blocks. 

### What is state based endorsement policy?
### Answer :
- The state-based endorsement allows the default chaincode-level endorsement policies
- It can be be overridden by a different policy for the specified keys.
